<h3>INEDITED POEM BY POPE.</h3>

  <p>In an original letter from James Boaden to Northcote the artist, I
  find the following passage; and I add to it the verses to which allusion
  is therein made:</p>

  <p class="author">"60. Warren Street, Fitzroy Square.<br/>"28th August, 1827.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"My dear friend,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"The verses annexed are so fine, that you should put them into your
  copy of Pope, among the Miscellanies. Dr. Warburton received them too
  late for his edition of our poet, and I find them only in a letter from
  the prelate to Dr. Hurd, dated 'Prior Park, June 24th, 1765.'</p>

  <p>"I have used the freedom to mark a few of the finest touches with a
  pencil, to show you <i>my</i> feeling. These you can rub out easily, and
  afterwards indulge your own. The style of interrogation seems to have
  revived in Gray's Elegy. Hurd would send the verses to Mason as soon as
  he got them; and Mason and Gray, as you know, were <i>one</i> in all
  their studies.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"I do not forget the Fables.</p>
      <p class="i8hg3">"Yours, my dear friend, always,</p>
      <p class="i12hg3">"<span class="sc">J. Boaden.</span></p>
      <p class="hg3">"J. Northcote, Esq."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Not having by me any modern edition of Pope's <i>Works</i>, may I ask
  whether these verses, thus transcribed for Northcote by his friend
  Boaden, have yet been introduced to the public?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p><i>Verses by Mr. Pope, on the late Dean of Carlisle's (Dr. Bolton)
  having written and published a Paper to the Memory of Mrs. Butler, of
  Sussex, Mother to old Lady Blount of Twickenham.</i></p>

      <p>No, 'tis a spirit's nobler taste of bliss,</p>
      <p>That feels the worth it left, in proofs like this;</p>
      <p>That not its own applause but thine approves,</p>
      <p>Whose practice praises, and whose virtue loves;</p>
      <p>Who liv'st to crown departed friends with fame;</p>

<h3>SOUTHEY'S "DOCTOR;" ST. MATTHIAS' DAY IN LEAP-YEAR.</h3>

  <p>In looking over the 1848 edition of Southey's book, <i>The Doctor</i>,
  I observe an error which has escaped the care and revision of the editor,
  the Rev. J. W. Warter, B.D. At p. 199., where Southey is referring to the
  advantages of almanacs, he writes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Who is there that has not sometimes had occasion to consult the
  almanac? Maximilian I., by neglecting to do this, failed in an enterprise
  against Bruges. It had been concerted with his adherents in that
  turbulent city, that he should appear before it at a certain time, and
  they would be ready to rise in his behalf, and open the gates for him. He
  forgot that it was leap-year, and came a day too soon; and this error on
  his part cost many of the most zealous of his friends their lives. It is
  remarkable that neither the historian who relates this, nor the writers
  who have followed him, should have looked into the almanac to guard
  against any inaccuracy in the relation; <i>for they have fixed the
  appointed day on the eve of St. Matthias, which being the 23rd of
  February, could not be put out of its course by leap-year</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The words in Italics show Southey's mistake. This historian was quite
  correct: as, according to the calendar of the Roman Catholic Church,
  although the regular festival of St. Matthias is celebrated upon the 24th
  of February, yet, "in anno bissextili Februarius est dierum 29, et Festum
  S. Mathiæ celebratur 25 Februarii." Thus it will be seen, that the year
  when Maximilian was to have appeared before Bruges being leap-year, and
  the day appointed being the eve of St. Matthias, he should have come upon
  the 24th, not the 23rd of February: the leap-year making all the
  difference.</p>

<h3>OXFORDSHIRE LEGEND IN STONE.</h3>

  <p>A few miles from Chipping-Norton, by the side of a road which divides
  Oxfordshire from Warwickshire, and on the brow of a hill overlooking Long
  Compton, stand the remains of a Druidical temple. Leland speaks of them
  as "Rollright stones," from their being in the parish of Rollright. The
  temple consists of a single circle of stones, from fifty to sixty in
  number, of various sizes and in different positions, but all of them
  rough, time-worn, and mutilated. The peasantry say that it is impossible
  to count these stones, and certainly it is a difficult task, though not
  because there is any witchcraft in the matter, but owing to the peculiar
  position of some of them. You will hear of a certain baker who resolved
  not to be outwitted, so hied to the spot with a basketful of small
  loaves, one of which he placed on every stone. In vain he tried; either
  his loaves were not sufficiently numerous, or some sorcery displaced
  them, and he gave up in despair. Of course no one expects to succeed
  now.</p>

  <p>In a field adjoining are the remains of a cromlech, the altar where,
  at a distance from the people, the priests performed their mystic rites.
  The superimposed stone has slipped off, and rests against the others.
  These are the "Whispering Knights," and this their history:&mdash;In days
  of yore, when rival princes debated their claims to England's crown by
  dint of arms, the hostile forces were encamped hard by. Certain
  traitor-knights went forth to parley with others from the foe. While thus
  plotting, a great magician, whose power they unaccountably overlooked,
  transformed them all into stone, and there they stand to this day.</p>

  <p>Not far from the temple, but on the opposite side of the road, is a
  solitary stone, probably the last of two rows which flanked the approach
  to the sacred circle. This stone was once a prince who claimed the
  British throne. On this spot he inquired of the magician above named what
  would be his destiny:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"If Long Compton you can see,</p>
      <p>King of England you shall be,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>answered the wise man. But he could not see it, and at once shared the
  fate of the "Whispering Knights." This is called the "King's stone," and
  so stands that, while you cannot see Long Compton from it, you can if you
  go forward a very little way. On some future day an armed warrior will
  issue from this very stone, to conquer and govern our land!</p>

  <p>It is said that a farmer, who wished to bridge over a small stream at
  the foot of the hill, resolved to press the "Whispering Knights" into the
  service; but it was almost too much for all the horse power at his
  command to bring them down. At length they were placed, but all they
  could do was not sufficient to keep them in their place. It was therefore
  resolved to restore them to their original post, when, lo! they who
  required so much to bring them down, and defied all attempts to keep them
  quiet, were taken back almost without an effort by a single horse! So
  there they stand, <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span>till they and the rest (for I believe the
  large circle was once composed of living men) shall return to their
  proper manhood.</p>

  <p>Other legends respecting this curious relic might, I doubt not, be
  obtained on the spot. I obtained the above in answer to inquiries, when
  making a pilgrimage to the place.</p>

<h3>BISHOP BURNET.</h3>

  <p>Having but recently become acquainted with your useful and learned
  work (for <i>scire ubi aliquid invenire possis, magna pars eruditionis
  est</i>), I have been much interested in looking over the earlier
  volumes. Allow me to add a couple of links to your <i>catena</i> on
  Bishop Burnet. The first is the opinion of Hampton, the translator of
  Polybius; the other is especially valuable, it being nothing less than
  the portrait of Burnet drawn by himself, but certainly not with any idea
  of its being suspended beside the worthies of his "Own Time," for the
  edification of posterity.</p>

  <p>Hampton's testimony is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"His personal resentments put him upon writing history. He relates the
  actions of a persecutor and benefactor; and it is easy to believe that a
  man in such circumstances must violate the laws of truth. The remembrance
  of his injuries is always present, and gives venom to his pen. Let us add
  to this, that intemperate and malicious curiosity which penetrates into
  the most private recesses of vice. The greatest of his triumphs is to
  draw the veil of secret infamy, and expose to view transactions that were
  before concealed from the world; though they serve not in the least
  either to embellish the style or connect the series of his history, and
  will never obtain more credit than, perhaps, to suspend the judgment of
  the reader, since they are supported only by one single, <i>suspected</i>
  testimony."&mdash;<i>Reflections on Ancient and Modern History</i>, 4to.:
  Oxford, 1746.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Let me now refer you to a document, written with his own hand, which
  sets the question of <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page60"></a>{60}</span>Burnet's truthfulness and impartiality in
  his delineations of character completely at rest.</p>

  <p>From the Napier charter-chest, "by a species of retributive justice,"
  there has recently risen up in judgment against him <i>a letter of his
  own, proving his own character</i>. It is, I regret, too long for
  insertion in your pages <i>in extenso</i>, but no abstract can give an
  adequate idea of its contents. It is, in fact, so mean and abject as
  almost to overpass belief. I must refer your readers to Mr. Mark Napier's
  <i>Montrose and the Covenanters</i>, vol. i. pp. 13-21. All the
  reflections of the Whig historian Dalrymple, all the severe remarks of
  Swift and Lord Dartmouth, as to Burnet's dishonesty and malice, would now
  seem well bestowed upon a writer so despicable and faithless, and the
  credit of whose statements, when resting <i>on his own sole
  authority</i>, must be totally destroyed. This curious epistle was
  written, in an agony of fear, on a Sunday morning, during the memorable
  crisis of the Rye-House plot, and while Lord Russell was on the eve of
  his execution. Addressed to Lord Halifax, it was intended to meet the eye
  of the King. It evidently proves the writer's want of veracity in divers
  subsequent statements in his history. The future bishop also protests
  that he never will accept of any preferment, promises never more to
  oppose the Court, and intimates an intention to paint the King in the
  fairest light&mdash;"if I ever live to finish what I am about;"
  <i>i.e.</i> the <i>History of his Own Time</i>, in which the villanous
  portrait of Charles afterwards appeared.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Here, then," says Mr. Napier, "is Burnet <i>Redivivus</i>; and now
  the bishop may call Montrose a coward or what he likes, and persuade the
  world of his own super-eminent moral courage, if he can. For our own
  part, after reading the above letter, we do not believe one malicious
  word of what Burnet has uttered in the <i>History of his Own Time</i>
  against Charles I. and Montrose; and he has therein said nothing about
  them that is not malicious. We do not believe that the apology for
  Hamilton, which he has given to the world in the memoirs of that House,
  is by any means so truthful an exposition of the character of that
  mysterious marquis as the letters and papers entrusted to the bishop
  enabled him to give. We feel thoroughly persuaded that Bishop Burnet, in
  that work, as well as in the <i>History of his Own Time</i>, reversed the
  golden maxim of Cicero, '<i>Ne quid falsi dicere audeat, ne quid veri non
  audeat</i>.' The marvellous of himself, and the malicious of others, we
  henceforth altogether disbelieve, when resting on the sole authority of
  the bishop's historical record, and will never listen to when retailed
  traditionally and at second-hand from him. Finally, we do believe the
  truth of the anecdote, that the bishop, 'after a debate in the House of
  Lords, usually went home and altered everybody's character as they had
  pleased or displeased him that day;' and that he kept weaving in secret
  this chronicle of his times, not to enlighten posterity or for the cause
  of truth, but as a means of indulging in safety his own interested or
  malicious feelings towards the individuals that pleased or offended him.
  So much for Bishop Burnet, whose authority must henceforth always be
  received <i>cum nota</i>."</p>

  </div>

  <p>There lived, some thirty years since, in the eastern part of the
  suburbs of New Ross, in the county of Wexford, denominated the
  "Maudlins," a hedge carpenter named Davy Hanlan, better known to his
  neighbours by the sobriquet of "Milleadh Maide," or "Speilstick." Davy
  plied his trade with all the assiduity of an industrious man, "and
  laboured in all kinds of weather" to maintain his little family; and as
  his art consisted principally in manufacturing carts, ploughs, and
  harrows (iron ploughs not being then in use) for the surrounding farmers,
  and doctoring their old ones, the sphere of Davy's avocations was
  confined to no mean limits.</p>

  <p>It was a dry, sharp night, in the month of November, and darkness had
  set in long before Davy left Mount Hanover, two miles distant from his
  home. At length he started forward, and had already reached the bridge of
  the Maudlins, when he stopped to rest; for besides his tools he carried a
  bundle of wheaten straw, which he intended for a more than usually
  comfortable "shake-down" for his dear rib Winny. The moon had by this
  time ascended above the horizon, and by its silvery radiance depicted in
  delicate outline the hills rising in the distance, while the tender rays
  mixing with, and faintly illumining the gloom of the intermediate
  valleys, formed a mass of light and shade so exquisitely blended as to
  appear the work of enchantment. As Davy leaned on the parapet of the
  bridge, a thrill of alarm involuntarily disturbed his feelings: he was
  about to depart when he heard a clamorous sound, as of voices, proceeding
  from that part of the valley on which he still gazed. Curiosity now
  tempted him to listen still longer, when suddenly he saw a group of
  dwarfish beings emerging from the gloom, and coming rapidly towards him,
  along the green marsh that borders the Maudlin stream. Poor Davy was
  terror-stricken at this unusual sight; in vain he attempted to escape: he
  was, as it were, spellbound. Instantly the whole company gained the road
  beside him, and after a moment's consultation they simultaneously cried
  out, "Where is my horse? give me my horse!" &amp;c. In the twinkling of
  an eye they were all mounted. Davy's feelings may be more easily imagined
  than described, and in a fit of unconsciousness his tongue, as it were
  mechanically, articulated "Where is my horse?" Immediately he found
  himself astride on a rude piece of timber, somewhat in shape of a
  plough-beam, by which he was raised aloft in the air. Away he went, as he
  himself related, at the rate of nine knots an hour, gliding smoothly
  through the liquid air. No aeronaut ever performed his expedition with
  more intrepidity; and after about two hours' journeying the whole
  cavalcade alighted in the midst of a large city, just as</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The iron tongue of midnight had told twelve."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>One of the party, who appeared to be a leader, conducted them from
  door to door, Davy following in the rear; and at the first door he passed
  them the word, "We cannot enter, the dust of the floor lies not behind
  the door."<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  Other impediments prevented their ingress to the next two or three
  doors.</p>

  <p>At length, having come to a door which was not guarded by any of these
  insuperable sentinels which defy the force of fairy assault, he joyfully
  cried out "We can enter here:" and immediately, as if by enchantment, the
  door flew open, the party entered, and Davy, much astonished, found
  himself within the walls of a spacious wine-store. Instantly the heads of
  wine vessels were broken; bungs flew out; the carousing commenced; each
  boon companion pledged his friend, as he bedewed his whiskers in the
  sparkling beverage; and the wassail sounds float round the walls and
  hollow roof. Davy, not yet recovered from his surprise, stood looking on,
  but could not contrive to come at a drop: at length he asked a rather
  agreeable fairy who was close to him to help him to some. "When I shall
  have done," said the fairy, "I will give you this goblet, and you can
  drink." Very <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page62"></a>{62}</span>soon after he handed the goblet to Davy, who
  was about to drink, when the leader gave the word of command:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Away, away, my good fairies, away!</p>
      <p>Let's revel in moonlight, and shun the dull day."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The horses were ready, the party mounted, and Davy was carried back to
  the Maudlin bridge, bearing in his hand the silver goblet, as witness of
  his exploit. Half dead he made his way home to Winny, who anxiously
  awaited him; got to bed about four in the morning, to which he was
  confined by illness for months afterwards. And as Davy "lived from hand
  to mouth," his means were soon exhausted. Winny took the goblet and
  pledged it with Mr. Alexander Whitney, the watchmaker, for five
  shillings. In a few days after a gentleman who lived not twenty miles
  from Creywell Cremony came in to Mr. Whitney's, saw the goblet, and
  recognised it as being once in his possession, and marked with the
  initials "M. R.," and on examining it found it to be the identical one
  which he had bestowed, some years before, on a Spanish merchant. Davy,
  when able to get out, deposed on oath before the Mayor of Ross (who is
  still living) to the facts narrated above. The Spanish gentleman was
  written to, and in reply corroborated Davy's statement, saying that on a
  certain night his wine-store was broken open, vessels much injured, and
  his wine spilled and drunk, and the silver goblet stolen. Davy was
  exonerated from any imputation of guilt in the affair, and was careful,
  during his life, never again to rest at night on the Maudlin bridge.</p>

  <p>Every good housewife is supposed to sweep the kitchen floor previously
  to her going to bed; and the old women who are best skilled in "fairy
  lore" affirm, that if, through any inadvertence, she should leave the
  dust thus collected behind the door at night, this dust or sweepings will
  have the power of opening the door to the fairies, should they come the
  way. It is also believed that, if the broom should be left behind the
  door, without being placed standing on its handle, it will possess the
  power of admitting the fairies. Should the water in which the family had
  washed their feet, before going to bed, be left in the vessel, on the
  kitchen floor, without having a coal of fire put into it, if not thrown
  out in the yard, it will act as porter to the fairies or good people.</p>

  <p><i>The Duke of Wellington and Marshal Ney. Parallel Passage in the
  Life of Washington and Major André.</i>&mdash;J. R. of Cork (Vol. vi., p.
  480.) tells how Wellington was in his youth smitten with the charms of a
  lady, who, in after-life having appealed to him to save the life of Ney,
  was not simply unsuccessful in her object but was ordered to quit Paris
  forthwith. J. B. Burke, in the <i>Patrician</i>, vol. vi. p. 372., tells
  how Washington endeavoured to win the love of Mary Phillipse, and how he
  failed: how years rolled on, and the rejected lover as Commander-in-Chief
  of the American forces was supplicated by the same Mary, then the wife of
  Roger Morris, to spare the life of Andre. The appeal failed, and one of
  the General's aides was ordered to conduct the lady beyond the lines.</p>

  <p>It is no mean eulogy upon Lord Brooke's poem just referred to, to say

  and I am confident that many others of your readers sympathise with the
  wishes of <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley</span>, for "a collected edition
  of the works of the two noble Grevilles" ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. iv., p.
  139.). The facts upon which the tragedy of <i>Mustapha</i> is founded are
  graphically summed up by Knolles in his <i>Historie of the Turkes</i>,

  <p><i>St. Munoki's Day.</i>&mdash;Professor Craik, in his <i>Romance of
  the Peerage</i>, vol. ii. p. 337., with reference to the date of the
  death of Margaret Tudor, Queen Dowager of Scotland, gives two
  authorities, namely, 24th November, 1541, from the <i>Diurnal of
  Remarkable Occurrents</i>, and <i>St. Munoki's</i> Day, from the
  <i>Chronicle of Perth</i>, and then says: "I find no saint with a name
  resembling <i>Munok</i> in the common lists." Now this Note of mine has
  originated in the belief that I <i>have found</i> such a name in the
  <i>Calendar of Saints</i>, or at any rate one very closely resembling it,
  if not the identical <i>Munok</i>. "St. Marnok, B. patron of Killmarnock
  in Scotland, honoured on the 25th October in the Scots Calendar." Now
  "Marnok" is most probably <i>Munok</i>, the latter, perhaps, misspelt by
  a careless scribe in the <i>Chronicle of Perth</i>. There is a
  discrepancy of a month certainly in these two dates, 25th October and
  24th November; but that is not very wonderful, as a doubt of the exact
  day of Queen Margaret's decease evidently exists among historians, for
  Pinkerton (vol. ii. p. 371.) conjectures June. The above extract
  regarding St. Marnok is from a <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page63"></a>{63}</span>curious old work in my possession, published
  in 1761 in London, and entitled <i>A Memorial of Ancient British Piety,
  or a British Martyrology</i>. It gives also the names of St. Moroc, C.,
  Nov. 8; St. Munnu, Ab., Oct. 21, both saints in the Scottish
  calendar.</p>

  <p><i>Marlborough; Curious Case of Municipal Opposition to County

  the corporation of Marlborough so far defied the royal authority as to
  drive the quarterly county sessions from the town; and high legal

  the burgesses from the jurisdiction of the sheriff's "tourn," and that up
  till the period of the Municipal Reform bill, many charters still
  existed, verbally sustaining such right of exemption; but the Queries
  which I wish to put are the following. First, Though the crown's
  representative had no jurisdiction, had he not a right to enter, and sit
  on cases foreign to the borough? Secondly, What are the earliest
  instances of county quarter sessions sitting in independent boroughs?
  Thirdly, Were the cases numerous of similar acts of resistance at the
  period alluded to, viz. the reign of George I.?</p>

  <p>I take this occasion to state that I am drawing to conclusion a
  history of Silkely Hundred, which includes Marlborough and Lord
  Ailesbury's seat; and shall feel grateful for any information relating to
  the Pretender's influence in that district. That it must have been
  considerable may be argued from the Ailesbury alliance by marriage with
  the young Pretender.</p>

  <p><i>Wet Season in 1348.</i>&mdash;Accidentally looking into Holinshed a
  few days ago, I found that our present unusually wet season is not
  without a parellel, indeed much exceeded; as on that occasion the harvest
  must have been a complete failure, and dearth and disease consequently
  ensued. Providence, however, has kindly blessed us with an average
  harvest; and, exclusive of the disasters attendant upon storms and
  floods, I trust we shall escape any further visitation. I annex an
  extract of the passage in Holinshed:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In this 22 yeare [of Edward III., <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1348],
  from Midsummer to Christmasse, for the more part it continuallie rained,
  so that there was not one day and night drie togither, by reason whereof
  great flouds insued, and the ground therewith was sore corrupted, and
  manie inconueniences insued, as great sickenes, and other, insomuch that
  in the yeare following, in France, the people died wonderfullie in
  diverse places. In Italie also, and in manie other countries, as well in
  the lands of the infidels as in Christendome, this grieuous mortalitie
  reigned, to the great destruction of people. About the end of August, the
  like dearth began in diuerse places of England, and especiallie in
  London, continuing so for the space of twelue moneths following. And vpon
  that insued great barrennesse, as well of the sea as the land, neither of
  them yielding such plentie of things as before they had done. Wherevpon
  vittels and corne became scant and hard to come by."&mdash;<i>The
  Chronicles of Raphaell Holinshed</i>, fol., vol. iii. p. 378 (black

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>POPE AND THE MARQUIS MAFFEI.</h3>

  <p>I would beg the insertion of the following Note, which occurs at p.
  338. of Walker's <i>Historical Memoir on Italian Tragedy</i>; with a view
  to ascertaining whether any light has been thrown on the subject since
  the publication of the work in question. I fear there is little chance of
  such being the case, but still I would be glad to learn from any of your
  correspondents, whether there is other evidence than the passage given
  from the Marquis's letter to Voltaire, to prove that Pope was actually
  engaged in the translation of his tragedy; or whether there is any
  allusion in the cotemporary literature of the day, to such a work having
  been undertaken by the bard of Twickenham.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It seems to have escaped the notice of all Pope's biographers, that
  when the Marquis Maffei visited Twickenham, in company with Lord
  Burlington and Dr. Mead, he found the English bard employed on a
  translation of his <i>Merope</i>: yet the public have been in possession
  of this anecdote about fifty years. The Marquis, in his answer to the
  celebrated letter addressed to him by Voltaire, says: 'Avendomi Mylord
  Conte di Burlington, e il Sig. Dottore Mead, l'uno e l'altro talenti
  rari, ed à quali quant' io debba non posso dire, condotto alla villa del
  Sig. Pope, ch' è il Voltaire dell Inghilterra, come voi siete il Pope
  della Francia, quel bravo Poeta mi fece vedere, che lavorava alla
  versione della mia Tragedia in versi Inglesi: se la terminasse, e che ne
  sia divenuto, non so.'&mdash;<i>La Merope</i>, ver. 1745, p. 180. With
  the fate of this version we are, and probably shall ever remain,
  unacquainted: it may, however, be safely presumed, that it was never
  finished to the satisfaction of the translator, and therefore committed
  to the flames."</p>

<h3>THE CHURCH CATECHISM.</h3>

  <p>Allow me to make the following inquiries through the pages of "N.
  &amp; Q.," which may possibly elicit valuable information from some of
  your many correspondents. In the Archbishop of York's questions put to
  candidates for Holy Orders, Feb. 1850, occurred this Query: "The Church
  Catechism ... by whom was the latter part added and put into its present
  form; and whence is it chiefly derived?" The former part of this is
  readily answered; being, as any one at all read in the history of the
  Prayer-Book well knows, added at the Hampton Court Conference, 1603; and
  was drawn up by Bishop Overall, at that time Dean of St. Paul's: but
  <i>whence is it chiefly derived?</i> That is the question for which I
  have hitherto sought in vain a satisfactory solution, and fear his grace,
  or his examining chaplain, must have looked in vain for a correct reply
  from any of his <i>quasi</i> clergymen, college education though they may
  have had. It is a point which seems to be passed over entirely unnoticed
  by all of our liturgical writers and church historians, as I have been at
  no little pains in searching works at all likely to clear it up, but,
  hitherto, without success. It may be conjectured that the part referred
  to, viz., on the Sacraments, was taken from Dean Nowell's Catechism; or,
  at all events, that Overall borrowed some of the expressions while he
  changed its meaning, as Nowell's was purely Calvinistic in tendency. He
  may have had before him the fourth part of Peter Lombard's <i>Liber
  Sententiarum</i>, or some such work. But all this is mere supposition;
  and what I want to arrive at, is some correct data or authoritative
  statement which would settle the point. Another interesting matter upon
  which I am desirous of information, is, as to the protestation after the
  rubrics at the end of the Communion Service. In our <i>present</i>
  Prayer-Book it is in marks of quotation, which we do not find in the
  second book of King Edward VI., where it originally appears&mdash;and the
  expressions there admit the real presence. It was altogether left out in
  Elizabeth's Prayer-Book, but again inserted in the last review in 1661,
  when the inverted commas first appear: the sense being somewhat
  different, allowing the spiritual but not the actual or bodily presence
  of Christ. Why are the <i>commas</i> or marks of quotation, if such they
  be, then inserted? I have written to a well-known Archdeacon, eminent for
  his works on the Sacraments, but his answer does not convey what is
  sought by</p>

<h3>A COUNTESS OF SOUTHAMPTON.</h3>

  <p>I have just been reading, in the <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i>, an
  interesting article upon the recently-published <i>Memoirs of
  Mademoiselle de K&oelig;nigsmark</i>, in which I meet with the following
  passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ce fut à Venise que Charles-Jean de K&oelig;nigsmark rencontra la
  belle Comtesse de Southampton, cette vaillante amoureuse qui, plantant la
  fortune et famille, le suivit désormais par le monde déguisée en page:
  romanesque anecdote que la princesse Palatine a consignée dans ses
  mémoires avec cette brusque rondeur de style qui ne marchande pas les
  expressions. 'Il doit être assez dans le caractère de quelques dames
  anglaises de suivre leurs amans. J'ai connu un Comte de K&oelig;nigsmark
  qu'une dame anglaise avait suivi en habit de page. Elle était avec lui à
  Chambord, et comme, faute de place, il ne pouvait loger au Château, il
  avait fait dresser dans la forêt une tente où il logeât. Il me raconta
  son aventure à la Masse; j'eu la curiosité de voir le soi-disant page. Je
  n'ai jamais rien vu de plus beau que cette figure: les plus beaux yeux du
  monde, une bouche charmante, une prodigieuse quantité de cheveux du plus
  beau brun, qui tombèrent en grosses boucles sur ses épaules. Elle sourit
  en me voyant, se doutant bien que je savais son secret. <!-- Page 65
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span>Lorsqu'il partit
  de Chambord pour l'Italie, le Comte K&oelig;nigsmark se trouva dans une
  auberge, et en sortit le matin pour faire un tour de promenade. L'hotesse
  de cette maison courut après lui et lui cria: 'Montez vite là-haut,
  Monsieur, votre page accouche!' Le page accoucha en effet d'une fille: on
  mit la mère et l'enfant dans un couvent à Paris."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He afterwards went to England, where&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Les frères, cousins, et petits cousins de lady Southampton
  l'attendaient, et les duels se mirent à lui pleuvoir dessus. Comme son
  épée aimait assez à luire au soleil, il la tira volontiers, et avec une
  chance telle que ses ennemis, ne pouvant le vaincre par le fer, jugèrent
  à propos d'essayer du poison. Dégouté de perdre son temps à de pareilles
  misères, &amp;c. &amp;c. Tant que le comte a vecu il en a eu grand soin;
  mais il mourut en Morée, et le page fidèle ne lui survécut pas
  long-temps. Elle est morte comme une sainte."</p>

  <p>Can you, or any of your correspondents, say <i>who</i> this
  interesting <i>Countess of Southampton</i> was? She lived at the end of

  the trimming up elm-trees in the hedge-rows, by cutting away all the
  branches except at the head: "to shob the trees" is the expression. Now,

  or correct. It would be interesting to have a complete list of such
  bishops, with the names of their sees, and dates of consecration and

  for Colchester 12th November, 1592, and this from the valuable list in

  He was descended from the ancient Scottish family of Stewarts of Appin,

  <p><i>Robert Wauchope, Archbishop of Armagh, 1543.</i>&mdash;Is there any
  detailed account of this prelate extant? The few particulars I have been
  able to glean respecting him are merely that he was a native of Scotland,
  and Doctor in Divinity of the University of Paris, where he probably
  studied theology, as was common with Scottish ecclesiastics of that day.
  He arrived in Ireland about the year 1541, and is memorable for the
  glory, or shame, of being the first who introduced the Jesuit order into
  that country. Pope Paul III. nominated him to the primatial see of
  Armagh, after the death of Archbishop Cromer in 1543, and during the
  lifetime of Archbishop Dowdal, who was a Catholic also, but being
  appointed Archbishop of Armagh in November 1543, by King Henry VIII., was
  not acknowledged at Rome as such. <i>Waucup</i>, as his name is also
  spelt, and Latinized "Venantius," never appears, however, to have been
  able to obtain regular possession of the see of Armagh and primacy of
  Ireland, being merely titular archbishop. Some accounts state that he was
  blind from his childhood, but others say, and probably more correctly,
  that he was only short-sighted. He was present at the Council of Trent in
  1545-47, being one of the four Irish prelates who attended there; and, in
  <i>Hist. del Concil. Trid.</i>, l. ii. p. 144., he is alluded to as
  having been esteemed the <i>best at riding post in the
  world!</i>&mdash;"Huomo di brevissima vista era commendato di questa, di
  correr alla posta meglio d'huomo del mondo." I should like much to
  ascertain the date and place of his birth, consecration, and death.</p>

  June 7, 1809:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At Paignton Fair, near Exeter, the ancient custom of drawing through
  the town a plum-pudding of an immense size, and afterwards distributing
  it to the populace, <i>was revived</i> on Tuesday last. The ingredients
  which composed this enormous pudding were as follows: 400 lbs. of flour,
  170 lbs. of beef suet, 140 lbs. of raisins, and 240 eggs. It was kept
  constantly boiling in a brewer's copper from Saturday morning to the
  Tuesday following, when it was placed on a car decorated with ribbons,
  evergreens, &amp;c., and drawn along the street by eight oxen."</p>

  <p><i>Immoral Works.</i>&mdash;What ought to be done with works of this
  class? It is easy to answer, "destroy them:" but you and I know, and Mr.
  Macaulay has acknowledged, that it is often necessary to rake into the
  filthiest channels for historical and biographical evidence. I,
  personally, doubt whether we are justified in destroying <i>any</i>
  evidence, however loathsome and offensive it may be. What, then, are we
  to do with it? It is impossible to keep such works in a private library,
  even under lock and key, for death opens locks more certainly than Mr.
  Hobbs himself. I think such ought to be preserved in the British Museum,
  entered in its catalogue, but only permitted to be seen on good reasons
  formally assigned in writing, and not then allowed to pass into the
  reading-room. What is the rule at the Museum?</p>

  <p>I ask these questions because I have, by accident, become possessed of
  a poem (about 1500 lines) which professes to be written by Lord Byron, is

  <p>More specific reference will not be necessary for those who have seen
  the work. Is the writer known? I am somewhat surprised that not one of
  Byron's friends has, so far as I know, hinted a denial of the authorship;
  for, scarce as <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  have seen it; and, under existing circumstances, it is possible that a

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 320.)</p>

  <p>I had hoped that the inquiry of R. S. F. would have drawn out some of
  your Edinburgh correspondents; but, as they are silent upon a subject
  they might have invested with interest, allow me to say a word upon these
  Canongate marriages. I need not, I think, tell R. S. F. how loosely our
  countrymen, at the period alluded to, and long subsequent thereto, looked
  upon the marriage tie; as almost every one who has had occasion to touch
  upon our <i>domestic</i> manners and customs has pointed at, what
  appeared to them, and what really was, an anomaly in the character of a
  nation somewhat boastful of their better order and greater sense of
  propriety and decorum.</p>

  <p>Besides the incidental notices of travellers, the legal records of
  Scotland are rife with examples of litigation arising out of these
  irregular marriages; and upon a review of the whole history of such in
  the north, it cannot be denied that, among our staid forefathers,
  "matrimony was more a matter of merriment"<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> than a solemn and religious
  engagement.</p>

  <p>The Courts in Scotland usually <i>frowned</i> upon cases submitted to
  them where there was a strong presumption that either party had been
  victimised by the other; but, unfortunately, the requirements were so
  simple, and the facility of procuring witnesses so great, that many a
  poor frolicksome fellow paid dearly for his joke by finding himself
  suddenly transformed, from a bachelor, to a spick and span Benedict; and
  that too upon evidences which would not in these days have sent a
  fortune-telling impostor to the tread-mill: the lords of the justiciary
  being content that some one had heard him use the endearing term of wife
  to the pursuer, or had witnessed a mock form at an obscure public-house,
  or that the parties were by habit and repute man and wife. How truly then
  may it have been said, that a man in the Northern Capital, so open to
  imposition, scarcely knew whether he was married or not.</p>

  <p>In cases where the ceremony was performed, it <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span>did not follow that the
  priest of Hymen should be of the clerical profession:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To tie the knot," says John Hope, "there needed none;</p>
      <p>He'd find a clown, in brown, or gray,</p>
      <p>Booted and spurr'd, should preach and pray;</p>
      <p>And, without stir, grimace, or docket,</p>
      <p>Lug out a pray'r-book from his pocket;</p>
      <p>And tho' he blest in wond'rous haste,</p>
      <p>Should tie them most securely fast."</p>
      <p class="i10"><i>Thoughts</i>, 1780.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In Chambers's <i>Traditions of Edinburgh</i>, there is a slight
  allusion to these Canongate marriages:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The White Horse Inn," says he, "in a close in the Canongate, is an
  exceedingly interesting old house of entertainment. It was also
  remarkable for the runaway couples from England, who were married in its
  large room."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The White Hart, in the Grass-market, appears to have been another of
  these Gretna Green houses.</p>

  <p>A curious fellow, well known in Edinburgh at the period referred to,
  was the high priest of the Canongate hymeneal altar. I need hardly say
  this was the famous "Claudero, the son of Nimrod the Mighty Hunter," as
  he grandiloquently styled himself: otherwise James Wilson, a disgraced
  schoolmaster, and poet-laureate to the Edinburgh <i>canaille</i>. In the
  large rooms of the above inns, this comical fellow usually presided, and
  administered relief to gallant swains and love-sick damsels, and a most
  lucrative trade he is said to have made of it:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Claudero's skull is ever dull,</p>
      <p>Without the sterling shilling:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>in allusion to their being called half-merk or shilling marriages.</p>

  <p>Chambers gives an illustrative anecdote of our subjects' matrimonial
  practices in that of a soldier and a countryman seeking from Wilson a
  cast of his office: from the first Claudero took his shilling, but
  demanded from the last a fee of five, observing&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I'll hae this sodger ance a week a' the times he's in Edinburgh, and
  you (the countryman) I winna see again."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Scottish poetical antiquary is familiar with this eccentric
  character; but it may not be uninteresting to your general readers to
  add, that when public excitement in Edinburgh ran high against the Kirk,
  the lawyers, meal-mongers, or other <i>rogues</i> in <i>grain</i>,
  Claudero was the vehicle through which the democratic voice found vent in
  squibs and broadsides fired at the offending party or obnoxious measure
  from his lair in the Canongate.</p>

  <p>In his <i>Miscellanies</i>, Edin. 1766, now before me, Claudero's
  cotemporary, Geordie Boick, in a poetical welcome to London, thus
  compliments Wilson, and bewails the condition of the modern Athens under
  its bereavement of the poet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The ballad-singers and the printers,</p>
      <p>Must surely now have starving winters;</p>
      <p>Their press they may break a' in splinters,</p>
      <p class="i10">I'm told they swear,</p>
      <p>Claudero's Muse, alas! we've tint her</p>
      <p class="i10">For ever mair."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>For want of Claudero's <i>lash</i>, his eulogist goes on to say:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Now Vice may rear her hydra head,</p>
      <p>And strike defenceless Virtue dead;</p>
      <p>Religion's heart may melt and bleed,</p>
      <p class="i10">With grief and sorrow,</p>
      <p>Since Satire from your streets is fled,</p>
      <p class="i10">Poor Edenburrow!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Claudero was, notwithstanding, a sorry poet, a lax moralist, and a
  sordid parson; but peace to the manes of the man, or his successor in the
  latter office, who gave me in that same long room of the White Horse in
  the Canongate of Edinburgh the best parents son was ever blest with!</p>

<h3>LADY KATHERINE GREY.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 578.)</p>

  <p>There appears to be some doubt if the alleged marriage ever did take
  place, for I find, in Baker's <i>Chronicles</i>, p. 334., that in 1563
  "divers great persons were questioned and condemned, but had their lives
  spared," and among them&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Lady Katherine Grey, daughter to Henry Grey Duke of Suffolk, by the
  eldest daughter of Charles Brandon, having formerly been married to the
  Earl of Pembroke's eldest son, and from him soon after lawfully divorced,
  was some years after found to be with child by Edward Seymour Earl of
  Hartford, who, being at that time in France, was presently sent for: and
  being examined before the Archbishop of Canterbury, and affirming they
  were lawfully married, but not being able within a limited time to
  produce witnesses of their marriage, they were both committed to the
  Tower."</p>

<h3>HOWLETT THE ENGRAVER.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. i., p. 321.)</p>

  <p>In your first Volume, an inquiry is made for information respecting
  the above person. As I find on referring to the subsequent volumes of "N.
  &amp; Q." that the Query never received any reply, I beg to forward a
  cutting from the Obituary of the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i> for June,
  1828, referring to Howlett; concerning whom, however, I cannot give any
  further information.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"MR. BARTHOLOMEW HOWLETT.</p>

  <p>"Lately in Newington, Surrey, aged sixty, Mr. Bartholomew Howlett,
  antiquarian, draughtsman, and engraver. This artist was a pupil of Mr.
  Heath, and for many years devoted his talents to the embellishment of
  works on topography and antiquities. His principal publication, and which
  will carry his name down to posterity with respect as an artist, was <i>A
  Selection of Views in the County of Lincoln; comprising the Principal
  Towns and Churches, the Remains of Castles and Religious Houses, and
  Seats of the Nobility and Gentry; with Topographical and Historical
  Accounts of each View</i>. This handsome work was completed in 4to. in
  1805. The drawings are chiefly by T. Girtin, Nattes, Nash, Corbould,
  &amp;c., and the engravings are highly creditable to the burin of Mr.
  Howlett. Mr. Howlett was much employed by the late Mr. Wilkinson on his
  <i>Londina Illustrata</i>; by Mr. Stevenson in his second edition of
  Bentham's <i>Ely</i>; by Mr. Frost, in his recent <i>Notices of Hull</i>;
  and in numerous other topographical works. He executed six plans and
  views for Major Anderson's <i>Account of the Abbey of St. Denis</i>; and
  occasionally contributed to the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, and engraved
  several plates for it. In 1817, Mr. Howlett issued proposals for <i>A
  Topographical Account of Clapham, in the County of Surrey, illustrated by
  Engravings</i>. These were to have been executed from drawings by
  himself, of which he made several, and also formed considerable
  collections; but we believe he only published one number, consisting of
  three plates and no letter-press. We hope the manuscripts he has left may
  form a groundwork for a future topographer. They form part of the large
  collections for Surrey, in the hands of Mr. Tytam. In 1826, whilst the
  Royal Hospital and Collegiate Church of St. Katharine, near the Tower,
  was pulling down, he made a series of drawings on the spot, which it was
  his intention to have engraved and published. But the greatest effort of
  his pencil was in the service of his kind patron and friend, John Caley,
  Esq., F.R.S., F.S.A., keeper of the records in the Augmentation Office.
  For this gentleman Mr. Howlett made finished drawings from upwards of a
  thousand original seals of the monastic and religious houses of this
  kingdom."</p>

<h3>CHAUCER.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 603.)</p>

  <p>In reference to the question raised by J. N. B., what authority there
  is for asserting that Chaucer pursued the study of the law at the Temple,
  I send you the following extract from a sketch of his life by one of his
  latest biographers, Sir Harris Nicolas:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It has been said that Chaucer was originally intended for the law,
  and that, from some cause which has not reached us, and on which it would
  be idle to speculate, the design was abandoned. The acquaintance he
  possessed with the classics, with divinity, with astronomy, with so much
  as was then known of chemistry, and indeed with every other branch of the
  scholastic learning of the age, proves that his education had been
  particularly attended to; and his attainments render it impossible to
  believe that he quitted college at the early period at which persons
  destined for a military life usually began their career. It was not then
  the custom for men to pursue learning for its own sake; and the most
  rational manner of accounting for the extent of Chaucer's acquirements,
  is to suppose that he was educated for a learned profession. The
  knowledge he displays of divinity would make it more likely that he was
  intended for the church than for the bar, were it not that the writings
  of the Fathers were generally read by all classes of students. One writer
  says that Chaucer was a member of the Inner Temple, and that while there
  he was fined two shillings for beating a Franciscan friar in Fleet
  Street<a name="footnotetag3" href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>; and
  another (Leland) observes, that after he had travelled in France,
  'collegia leguleiorum frequentavit.' Nothing, however, is positively
  known of Chaucer until the autumn of 1359, when he himself says he was in
  the army with which Edward III. invaded France, and that he served for
  the first time on that occasion."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following remarks are from the <i>Life of Chaucer</i>, by William
  Godwin, Lond. 1803, vol. i. p. 357.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The authority which of late has been principally relied upon with
  respect to Chaucer's legal education is that of Mr. Speght, who, in his
  <i>Life of Chaucer</i>, says, 'Not many yeeres since, Master Buckley did
  see a record in the same house [the Inner Temple], where Geoffrey Chaucer
  was fined two shillings for beating a Franciscane fryar in
  Fleet-streete.' This certainly <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span>would be excellent evidence, were it not for
  the dark and ambiguous manner in which it is produced. I should have been
  glad that Mr. Speght had himself seen the record, instead of Master
  Buckley, of whom I suppose no one knows who he is: why did he not? I
  should have been better satisfied if the authority had not been
  introduced with so hesitating and questionable a phrase as 'not many
  yeeres since;' and I also think that it would have been better if Master
  Buckley had given us the date annexed to the record; as we should then at
  least have had the satisfaction of knowing whether it did not belong to
  some period before our author was born, or after he had been committed to
  the grave. Much stress, therefore, cannot be laid upon the supposition of
  Chaucer having belonged to the Society of the Inner Temple."</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Pyrogallic Acid</i> (Vol. vi., p. 612.).&mdash;In answer to the
  Query of your correspondent E. S., I beg to give the following method of
  preparing pyrogallic acid (first published by Dr. Stenhouse), which I
  have tried and found perfectly successful.</p>

  <p>Make a strong aqueous infusion of powdered galls; pour it off from the
  undissolved residue, and carefully evaporate to dryness by a gentle heat:
  towards the conclusion of the process the extract is very liable to burn;
  this is best prevented by continued stirring with a glass or porcelain
  spatula. Next, procure a flat-bottomed iron pan, about ten inches
  diameter and five inches deep. Make a hat of cartridge paper pasted
  together, about seven inches high, to slip over and accurately fit the
  top of the iron pan. Strew the bottom of the pan with the gall extract to
  the depth of three-quarters of an inch; over the top stretch and tie a
  piece of bibulous paper pierced with numerous pin-holes; over this place
  the hat, and tie it also tightly round the top of the pan.</p>

  <p>The whole apparatus is now to be placed in a sand-bath, and heat
  cautiously applied. It is convenient to place a glass thermometer in the
  sand-bath as near the iron pan as possible. The heat is to be continued
  about an hour, and to be kept as near 420° Fah. as possible; on no
  account is it to exceed 450°. The vapour of the acid condenses in the
  hat, and the crystals are prevented from falling back into the pan by the
  bibulous paper diaphragm. When it is supposed that the whole of the acid
  is sublimed, the strings are to be untied, and the hat and diaphragm
  cautiously taken off together; the crystals will be found in considerable
  quantity, and should be removed into a stoppered bottle; they should be
  very brilliant and perfectly white; if there is any yellow tinge, the
  heat has been too great.</p>

  <p>I believe that close attention to the above details will ensure
  success to any one who chooses to try the process, but at the same time I
  must remind your correspondents that scarcely any operation in chemistry
  is perfectly successful the first time of trial.</p>

  <p><i>Stereoscopic Pictures with One Camera</i> (Vol. vi., p.
  587.).&mdash;In reply to the inquiry of <span class="sc">Ramus</span>,
  allow me to say the matter is not difficult. My plan is as
  follows:&mdash;Suppose a piece of still-life to be the subject. Set up
  the camera at such a distance as will give a picture of the size
  intended, suppose it sixteen feet from the principal and central object;
  by means of a measuring tape or a piece of string, measure the exact
  distance from the principal object to the front of the camera. Take and
  complete the first picture; if it prove successful, remove the camera
  about two feet either to the right or left of its first station
  (<i>i.e.</i> according to the judgment formed as to which will afford the
  most artistic view of the subject), taking care by help of the tape or
  string to preserve the same distance between the principal object and the
  camera, and that the adjustment of focus is not disturbed. In other
  words, the camera must be moved to another part of the arc of a circle,
  of which the principal object is the centre, and the measured distance
  the radius. If the arc through which the camera is moved to its second
  station be too large, the stereoscopic picture will be unnaturally and
  unpleasingly distorted. The second picture is now to be taken.</p>

  <p>If the subject be a sitter, it is of the utmost importance to proceed
  as quickly as possible, as the identical position must be retained
  movelessly till both pictures are completed. This (in my experience) is
  scarcely practicable with collodion pictures, unless by the aid of an
  assistant and two levelled developing-stands in the dark closet; for the
  time occupied by starting the first picture on its development, and
  preparing the second glass plate (scarcely less than three or four
  minutes), will be a heavy tax on the quiescent powers of the sitter. This
  difficulty is avoided by adopting the Daguerreotype process, as the
  plates can be prepared beforehand, and need not be developed before both
  pictures are taken. In this case the only delay between the pictures is
  in the shifting the position of the camera. This is readily done by
  providing a table of suitable height (instead of the ordinary tripod), on
  which an arc of a circle is painted, having for its centre the place of
  the sitter. If the sitter be at the distance of eleven or twelve feet (my
  usual distance with a 3¼ inch Voightlander), the camera need not be moved
  more than ten or twelve inches; and even this distance produces some
  visible distortion to an accurate observer.</p>

  <p>The second levelling stand is required when using the collodion
  process, because the second <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>picture will be ready for development before
  the developing and fixing of the first has set its stand at liberty.</p>

  <p><i>Mr. Crookes' Wax-paper Process</i> (Vol. vi., p. 613.).&mdash;R. E.
  wishes to know the exact meaning of the sentence, "With the addition of
  as <i>much free iodine</i> as will give it a sherry colour." After adding
  the iodide of potassium to the water, a small quantity of iodine (this
  can be proctored at any operative chemist's) is to be dissolved in the
  mixture until it be of the proper colour.</p>

  <p>The paper is decidedly more sensitive if exposed wet, but it should
  not be washed; and I think it is advisable to have a double quantity of
  nitrate of silver in the exciting bath. I have not yet tried any other
  salt than iodide of potassium for the first bath; but I hope before the
  summer to lay before your readers a simpler, and I think superior
  wax-paper process, upon which I am at present experimenting.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">William Crookes.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Hammersmith.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;I see that in the tables R. E. has given, he has nearly
  doubled the strength of my iodine bath. It should be twenty-four grains
  to the ounce, instead of forty-four; and he has entirely left out the
  iodine.</p>

  <p><i>India Rubber a Substitute for Yellow Glass.</i>&mdash;I think that
  I have made a discovery which may be useful to photographers. It is known
  that some kinds of yellow glass effectually obstruct the passage of the
  chemical rays, and that other kinds do not, according to the manner in
  which the glass is prepared.</p>

  <p>I have never heard or read of India rubber being used for this
  purpose; but I believe it will be found perfectly efficient, and will
  therefore state how I arrived at this conclusion.</p>

  <p>Having occasion to remove a slate from the side of my roof, to make an
  opening for my camera, I thought of a sheet of India rubber to supply the
  place of the slate, and thus obtain a flexible waterproof covering to
  exclude the wet, and to open and shut at pleasure. This succeeded
  admirably, but I found that I had also obtained a deep rich yellow
  window, which perfectly lighted a large closet, previously quite dark,
  and in which for the last ten days I have excited and developed the most
  sensitive iodized collodion on glass. I therefore simply announce the
  fact, as it may be of some importance, if verified by others and by
  further experiment. I have not yet tested it with a lens and the solution
  of sulphite of quinine, as I wished the sun to shine on the sheet of
  India rubber at the time, which would decide the question. However, sheet
  India rubber can be obtained of any size and thickness required: mine is
  about one-sixteenth of an inch thick, and one foot square; and the
  advantages over glass would be great in some cases, especially for a dark
  tent in the open air, as any amount of light might be obtained by
  stitching a sheet of India rubber into the side, which would fold up
  without injury. It is possible that gutta percha windows would answer the
  same purpose.</p>

  <p><i>Monument at Wadstena</i> (Vol. vi., pp. 388. 518.).&mdash;I have
  received the following (which I translate) from my friend in Denmark,
  whom I mentioned in my last communication on this monument:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is only about a month since I saw Queen Philippa's tombstone in
  the church of Vadstena Monastery. It is a very large stone, on which the
  device and inscription are cut in outline, but there is no <i>brass</i>
  about it. King Erik Menved's and Queen Ingeberg's monument in Ringsted
  Church is the finest brass I ever saw, and I have seen many."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is a good engraving of the brass alluded to, which is a very
  rich one, in <i>Antiquariske Annaler</i>, vol. iii.: Copenhagen, 1820.
  The inscriptions are curious, and the date 1319.</p>

  <p><i>David Routh, R. C. Bishop of Ossory</i> (Vol. iii., p.
  169.).&mdash;In the article on a Cardinal's Monument, by <span
  class="sc">Mr. J. Graves</span>, of Kilkenny, allusion is made to the
  monument of the above Catholic Bishop Routh or Rothe, as being in the
  Cathedral of St. Canice, Kilkenny, with his arms "surmounted by a
  <i>cardinal's hat</i>," and that he died some years after 1643. If <span
  class="sc">Mr. Graves</span> would give the date of this prelate's
  decease, or rather a copy of the full inscription on his monument, with a
  notice of the sculptured armorial bearings thereupon, he would be
  conferring a favour on a distant inquirer; and as <span class="sc">Mr.
  Graves</span> is, apparently, a resident at Kilkenny, no obstacle exists
  to prevent his complying with this request.</p>

  <p>Any notices procurable regarding Bishop Routh are well deserving of
  insertion in "N. &amp; Q.," for he was a man of deep learning and
  research, and is well known to have assisted the celebrated Archbishop
  Ussher of Armagh in the compilation of his <i>Primordia</i>, for which he
  had high compliments paid him by that eminent prelate, notwithstanding
  their being of different religions.</p>

  <p>Bishop Routh was also himself the author of a work on <i>Irish
  Ecclesiastical History</i>, now very rare, and seldom procurable
  complete. He published it anonymously, in two volumes 8vo., in the year
  1617, at "Coloniæ, apud Steph. Rolinum," with the following rather long
  title:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Analecta Sacra, Nova, et Mira, de Rebus Catholicorum in Hibernia:
  Divisa in tres partes, quarum I, Continet semestrem gravaminam
  relationem, secundâ hac editione novis adauctam additamentis, et Notis
  illustratam. II. Parænesin ad Martyres designatos. III. Processum
  Martyrialem quorundam Fidei Pugilium; Collectore et Relatore, T. N.
  Philadelpho."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I fear this has degenerated from a Note into a Query; however, I may
  state in conclusion, that <span class="sc">Mr. Graves</span> is in error
  in styling the hat on Bishop Routh's monument a cardinal's, for all
  Catholic prelates, and abbots also, have their armorial bearings
  surmounted by a hat, exactly similar to a cardinal's hat, with this
  difference only, that the number of tassels depending from it varies
  according to the rank of the prelate, from the <i>cardinal's</i> with
  fifteen tassels in five rows, down to that of a <i>prior</i> with three
  only on each side in two rows.</p>

  <p><i>Cardinal Erskine</i> (Vol. ii., p. 406.; Vol. iii., p.
  13.).&mdash;Several notices of this ecclesiastic have appeared in "N.
  &amp; Q.," but as none of them give the exact information required, I now
  do so, though perhaps tardily. He was born 13th February, 1753, at Rome,
  where his father, Colin Erskine, a Jacobite, and exiled scion of the
  noble Scottish house of Erskine, Earls of Kellie, had taken up his
  residence. "Monsignor Charles Erskine," having embraced the
  ecclesiastical life at an early age, and passed through several
  gradations in the Church of Rome, was, in 1785, "Promotore della Fede,"
  an office of the Congregation of Rites; in 1794 auditor to Pope Pius VI.,
  and raised to the purple by Pope Pius VII., who created him a
  <i>Cardinal</i><span class="nw">-Deacon</span> of the Holy Roman Church,
  25th February, 1801. Cardinal Erskine accompanied the latter pontiff in
  his exile from Rome in the year 1809, and died at Paris, 19th March,
  1811, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, and eleventh of his
  cardinalate.</p>

  <p><i>"Ne'er to these chambers," &amp;c.</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  14.).&mdash;In reply to <span class="sc">Aram's</span> Query: "Where do
  these lines come from?" they come from Tickell's sublime and pathetic
  "Elegy on the Death of Addison." <span class="sc">Aram</span> ("Wits have
  short memories," &amp;c.) has <i>misquoted</i> them. In a poem of so high
  a mood, to <i>displace</i> a word is to destroy a beauty. <span
  class="sc">Aram</span> has <i>interpolated</i> several words. The
  following is the <i>true</i> version:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ne'er to these chambers, where the mighty rest,</p>
      <p>Since their foundation, came a nobler guest,</p>

  <p>These lines are taken from the "Elegy on the Death of Addison,"
  written by Tickell. They are, if I remember rightly, inscribed on the
  gravestone recently placed over his remains by the Earl of Ellesmere, in
  the north aisle of Henry VII.'s Chapel. The last two lines which your
  correspondent quotes should be as follows:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Nor <i>e'er was to the bowers of bliss convey'd</i></p>

  <p><i>The Budget</i> (Vol. vi., p. 604.).&mdash;It may be useful to
  inform <span class="sc">Prestoniensis</span>, that, in a recent work on
  political economy, M. Ch. Coquelin says, that the word <i>budget</i>, in
  its present signification, has passed into France from England: the
  latter country having first borrowed it from the old French
  language&mdash;<i>bougette</i> signifying (and particularly in old
  Norman) a leather purse. It was the custom in England to put into a
  leather bag the estimates of receipts and expenditure presented to
  parliament: and hence, as Coquelin observes, the term passed from the
  containant to the contained, and, with this new signification, returned
  from this country into France; where it was first used in an official
  manner in the <i>arrêtés</i> of the Consul's 4th Themidor, year X, and
  17th Germinal, year XI.</p>

  <p class="author">F. H.</p>

  <p>"<i>Catching a Tartar</i>" (Vol. vi., p. 317.).&mdash;This common and
  expressive saying is thus explained in Arvine's <i>Cyclopædia</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In some battle between the Russians and the Tartars, who are a wild
  sort of people in the north of Asia, a private soldier called out,
  'Captain, halloo there! I've caught a Tartar!' 'Fetch him along then,'
  said the Captain. 'Ay, but he won't let me,' said the man. And the fact
  was the Tartar had caught him. So when a man thinks to take another in,
  and gets himself bit, they say he's caught a Tartar."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Grose says that this saying originated with an Irish soldier who was
  in the "Imperial," that is, I suppose he means the Austrian service. This
  is hardly probable; the Irish are made to father many sayings which do
  not rightly belong to them, and this I think may be safely written as one
  among the number.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Eirionnach</span> has now two references before him,
  Grose's <i>Glossary</i> and Arvine's <i>Cyclopædia</i>, in which his
  Query is partly explained, if he can but find the dates of their
  publication. In this search I regret I cannot assist him, as neither of
  these works are to be found in the libraries of this island; at least
  thus far I have not been able to meet with them.</p>

  <p><i>The Termination "-itis"</i> (Vol. vii., p. 13.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Adsum</span> asks: "What is the derivation of the term
  <i><span class="nw">-itis</span></i>, used principally in medical words,
  and these signifying, inflammation?" If "N. &amp; Q." were a medical
  journal, the question might be answered at length, to the great advantage
  of the profession; for, of late years, this termination has been tacked
  on by medical writers, especially foreigners, to words of all kinds, in
  utter defiance of the rules of language: as if a Greek affix were quite a
  natural ending to a Latin or French noun. <i><span
  class="nw">-itis</span></i> can with propriety be appended only to those
  Greek nouns whose adjectives end in <span title="-itês" class="grk"><span
  class="nw">-&iota;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>:</span> <i>e.g.</i> <span
  title="pleura, pleuritês" class="grk"
  >&pi;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&rho;&alpha;,
  &pi;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>; <span
  title="keras, keratitês" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf;,
  &kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>, &amp;c.
  <span title="Pleuritis" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> is
  used by Hippocrates. <span title="Pleura" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&rho;&alpha;</span> means the membrane
  lining the side of the chest: <span title="pleuritis" class="grk"
  >&pi;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>
  (<span title="nodos" class="grk"
  >&nu;&omicron;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> understood) is morbus
  lateralis, the side-disease, or pleurisy. In the same manner
  <i>keratitis</i> is a very legitimate synonym for disease of the horny
  coat (cornea) of the eye. But medical writers, disregarding the rules of
  language, have, for some years past, revelled in the use of their
  favourite <i><span class="nw">-itis</span></i> to a most ludicrous
  extent. Thus, from <i>cornea</i>, they make "corneitis," and describe an
  inflammation of the crystalline lens as <i>lentitis</i>. Nay, some French
  and German writers on diseases of the eyes have coined the monstrous word
  "Descemetitis," on the ground that one Monsieur Descemet discovered a
  structure in the eye, which, out of compliment to him, was called "the
  membrane of Descemet."</p>

  and pouring the hyposulphite of soda on the portion which is to be cut

  R. W. THOMAS cautions Photographers against unprincipled persons who
  (from the fact of Xyloidin and Collodion being synonymous terms) would
  lead them to imagine that the inferior compound sold by them at half the

  <p>"We can but hope, within the limited space at our disposal, to render
  a scanty and imperfect measure of justice to a work of such vast extent
  and varied erudition.... We would beg the reader, if he be disposed to
  doubt our opinion, to examine almost every single page out of the four
  thousand of which the work consists, in order that he may learn the true
  nature and extent of Mr. O'Donovan's editorial labours. Let him see the
  numberless minute verbal criticisms; the elaborate topographical
  annotations with which each page is loaded; the historical, genealogical,
  and biographical notices; the lucid and ingenious illustrations, drawn
  from the ancient laws, customs, traditions, and institutions of Ireland;
  the parallelisms and discrepancies of the narrative with that of other
  annalists, both native and foreign; the countless authorities which are
  examined and adjusted; the errors which are corrected; the omissions and
  deficiencies supplied; in a word, the curious and various learning which
  is everywhere displayed. Let him remember the mines from which all those
  treasures have been drawn are, for the most part, unexplored; that the
  materials thus laudably applied to the illustration of the text are in
  great part manuscripts which Ussher and Ware, even Waddy and Colgen, no

  <p>"Christmas has seldom produced a gift-book more creditable to all
  concerned in it than this beautiful volume. The poetry is well chosen;
  the passages being for the most part bits of real description, excellent
  in their kind, from the writings of our poets, from the time of Lord
  Surrey to that of Tennyson, with two or three beautiful bits from
  American authors. Now and then a poem is inserted, which, if not
  descriptive, is in spirit and feeling akin to the season to which it is
  referred; and this gives variety to what might otherwise be too great a
  mass of description. As a book of extracts merely, it would be an
  intelligent and creditable selection, made upon a distinct and coherent
  plan. But the drawings of Messrs. Foster, Davidson, Weir, Creswick, Cox,
  Duncan, and Branwhite, are a great addition to the volume; and the
  coloured engravings have been happy in catching the spirit and character
  of the artist themselves.</p>

  <p>"Though on a small scale, the feeling of some of the designs is
  admirable, specially those devoted to the illustration of spring and
  summer&mdash;the seasons which, both in poetry and painting, have the
  greatest amount of honour in this volume. The publisher is entitled to
  the praise of great care and attention to the appearance of the book; the
  colour and texture of the paper, the type, and the binding are
  unexceptionable. It is a book to do credit to any
  publisher."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>
